# Sources, people worked with, help given to: lab manual and TAs helped me. I did not help or work with anyone

## Section ONE

# Complete the following print statement to print out "Hello, COSC1010"
print('hello, COSC1010')

# Assign the string above to a variable named hello_message and print that variable
hello_message = "hello, COSC1010"
print(hello_message)

# Assign the string "cowboy joe" to a variable, and print that variable with title casing
mascot = 'cowboy joe'
print(mascot)


# Using f-strings and variables print out the solved solution for y = mx+b where:
# x = 2
# m = 1 
# b = 13 
# Your print message should be of the form "Given the variables m,x b we have y=m*x+b"
# Where  the variables ae replaced with their values in the string
x = 2
m = 1
b = 13
equation = f"y={m}*{x}"
print('Given the variables' {x}','{m}', and' {b}'we have '{y}''='{m}*{x}'+'{b}')

# This one is more advanced then the others and will involve several steps 
# Start by declaring the following variables:
# x = 5
# y = 7
# z = 9 
# print the sum of x,y,z
# Print the sum of y raised to the z with the result multiplied by x
# Print the result of raising z to the sum of x and y 
# Finally create two strings "Cowboy " and "Joe" (spacing in cowboy intentional)
# What happens if you add these two string together, assign it to a third variable, and print it
